# Computer-shop

This project is an introduction to fornt-end course and it's about creating a web-application to buy laptops, get loans from banks and fetch data from API and view it in a proper way. 

This project is written by using (HTML, CSS ,Javascript). 
The idea with this project is to get basic knowledge of front-end by using javascript. 
The user should be able to get a loan by clicking on "Get a loan" function, but the user is not allowed to get a loan than is twice as his balance. In the Work div, the user has his daily work that increase by clicking on work by 100.
The Bank button transfer should transfer work-pay-amount to the bank, unless if there is a loan, then it will discount 10% to the loan. 
In the laptop div we are fetching som data from the API.
In the last div there is specific information that are fetched from the API and a button to pay for the laptop.

For CSS, I used bootstrap and css file to style my elements.

Future work:
This project could be optimized in different ways. what I would to test is to use functions like ASYNC/AWAIT to fetching data from API.

This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for commerical purposes.
Thank you for checking this project, and feel free to pull down and make changeses.
